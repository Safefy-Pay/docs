description: "How to authenticate your requests in the Safefy API"
---

Safefy uses **OAuth2 Client Credentials** for authentication. You must obtain a JWT token before making any other request.

## How it works

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant App as Your Application
    participant Safefy as Safefy API
    
    App->>Safefy: POST /v1/auth/token (credentials)
    Safefy-->>App: JWT token (expires in 1h)
    App->>Safefy: GET /v1/transactions (Authorization: Bearer token)
    Safefy-->>App: Transaction data
```

## Getting the token

```bash
curl -X POST https://api-payment.safefypay.com.br/v1/auth/token \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "grantType": "client_credentials",
    "publicKey": "pk_sandbox_abc123...",
    "secretKey": "sk_sandbox_xyz789..."
  }'
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "data": {
    "accessToken": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...",
    "tokenType": "Bearer",
    "expiresIn": 3600,
    "environment": "Sandbox"
  }
}
```

## Using the token

Include the token in the `Authorization` header for all requests:

```bash
curl https://api-payment.safefypay.com.br/v1/transactions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9..."
```

<Warning>
The token expires in **1 hour** (3600 seconds). Refresh it before expiration to avoid interruptions.
</Warning>

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Never expose the secretKey" icon="shield">
    Keep the secretKey only on the backend. Never include it in frontend code or public repositories.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Use environment variables" icon="lock">
    Store credentials in environment variables or secret managers (AWS Secrets Manager, Vault, etc).
  </Card>
  <Card title="Refresh before expiration" icon="rotate">
    Implement logic to refresh the token before the 3600 seconds expire.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Restrict allowed IPs" icon="network-wired">
    In the Safefy dashboard, restrict credential usage to your server IPs.

## Common errors

| Code | Error | Solution |
|------|-------|----------|
| 401 | Invalid credentials | Check publicKey and secretKey |
| 403 | Unauthorized IP | Add the IP in the credential settings |
| 429 | Rate limit exceeded | Wait for the time indicated in Retry-After |
