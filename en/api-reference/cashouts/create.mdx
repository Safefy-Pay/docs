## Available balance

Always use the `withdrawNowAvailable` field from [`GET /v1/balance`](/en/api-reference/balance/get) to determine the amount available for your next cashout.

When `requiresFullWithdrawalNow` is `true`, you **must** withdraw exactly `withdrawNowAvailable`  no more, no less.

### Error codes

|------|-------------|
| `full_withdrawal_required` | `requiresFullWithdrawalNow` is `true` but the amount sent does not match `withdrawNowAvailable` |
| `insufficient_balance` | The requested amount exceeds `withdrawNowAvailable` |
