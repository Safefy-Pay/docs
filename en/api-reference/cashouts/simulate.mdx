Simulates a status change for a cashout, allowing you to test your integration without a real bank transfer.

## Parameters

<ParamField path="id" type="string" required>
  The unique UUID identifier of the cashout to simulate.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="action" type="integer" required>
  Action to simulate:
  - `1`  Moves the cashout to `Completed`
  - `2`  Moves the cashout to `Failed`
  - `3`  Moves the cashout to `Rejected`
</ParamField>

<Note>
Simulating a status change triggers webhooks normally. If the cashout has a `callbackUrl`, the corresponding webhook will be delivered.
