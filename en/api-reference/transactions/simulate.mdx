Simulates a status change for a transaction, allowing you to test your integration without real payments.

## Parameters

<ParamField path="id" type="string" required>
  The unique UUID identifier of the transaction to simulate.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="action" type="string" required>
  Action to simulate:
  - `pay`  Moves the transaction to `Completed`
  - `expire`  Moves the transaction to `Expired`
  - `fail`  Moves the transaction to `Failed`
  - `refund`  Moves the transaction to `Refunded` (only valid for `Completed` transactions)
</ParamField>

<Note>
Simulating a status change triggers webhooks normally. If the transaction has a `callbackUrl`, the corresponding webhook will be delivered.
