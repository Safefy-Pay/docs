This section presents the complete Safefy API reference, with **Try It** enabled to test endpoints directly.

## How to use

1. Generate a token at [Authentication](/en/authentication)
2. Open the [API Reference](/en/api-reference/reference) page
3. Click **Try It** and enter your token in the `Authorization` field in the format `Bearer <token>`

## Environments

- **Sandbox**: for testing and simulations
- **Production**: for real transactions

## Sandbox (recommended to start)

Use the Sandbox environment to simulate payments and validate your integration. You can:

- Create PIX transactions without real money movement
- Simulate status changes via `/v1/transactions/{id}/simulate`
- Receive webhooks with test events

## Authentication

All protected endpoints use **Bearer Token** in the `Authorization` header.

## Methods and endpoints

HTTP methods (GET, POST, PATCH, etc.) and request/response schemas are displayed in **Try It**. Each endpoint can be tested directly in the reference.
