Returns the current balance of the authenticated merchant.

All monetary values are in **cents** (e.g., `1500` = R$15.00).

## Response fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `available` | Confirmed balance available for immediate withdrawal |
| `withdrawNowAvailable` | Exact amount available for the next cashout |
| `requiresFullWithdrawalNow` | When `true`, the next cashout must be exactly `withdrawNowAvailable` |
| `pending` | Payments received but still in the settlement period |
| `reserved` | Amount locked due to cashouts in processing or disputes |
| `total` | `available` + `pending` + `reserved` |

<Warning>
Always use `withdrawNowAvailable` when creating a cashout. If `requiresFullWithdrawalNow` is `true`, your cashout request must use that exact amount.
</Warning>

<Note>
All values are returned in cents (integers). Divide by 100 to get the value in BRL.
