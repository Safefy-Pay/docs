## Understanding your balance

### Available
Confirmed funds from completed payments in the current settlement cycle. This amount is free for immediate withdrawal.

### Pending
Payments that have been received but are still being processed or settling. These funds will move to `available` after confirmation.

### Reserved
Funds locked for active purposes:
- Cashouts currently in `Processing` status
- Amounts held for dispute or chargeback resolution

### Total
The sum of all three: `available + pending + reserved`. This is the full balance in your account, regardless of accessibility.
