## What is Safefy?

Integrating payments can be hard: confusing docs, heavy SDKs, inconsistent responses. **Safefy** was built to solve that.

We are a **PIX** payments platform that offers:

- **PIX** as a fast, secure payment method aligned with best practices
- A complete and intuitive financial management interface
- Dedicated and responsive support

## Organization structure

In Safefy, a **user** can create and manage **multiple organizations**. Each organization represents a different CNPJ or business.

**How it works:**

- Each organization has its own **balance**, **transactions**, **customers**, and **API credentials**
- Data is fully **isolated** across organizations
- A user can switch between organizations in the dashboard
- API credentials are tied to a specific organization

<Info>
When you create an API credential, it belongs to the organization selected at that moment. All transactions made with that credential will be recorded under that organization.

## Simple API

Our API was built around three principles:

### 1. Intent-based

You say **what you want to do**, and we handle the rest. To create a PIX charge:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api-payment.safefypay.com.br/v1/transactions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {token}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "method": "pix",
    "amount": 1000,
    "currency": "BRL",
    "description": "Monthly subscription"
  }'
```

### 2. Idempotent

Use the `externalId` field to ensure a duplicate request does not create duplicate resources. If you send the same `externalId` twice, the second request will be ignored.

```json
{
  "externalId": "order-123",
  "method": "pix",
  "amount": 1000,
  "currency": "BRL"
}
```

### 3. Consistent

All responses follow the same pattern for both success and error:

```json
// Success
{
  "data": {
    "id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
    "status": "Pending",
    "amount": 1000
  },
  "message": "Transaction created successfully"
}
```

```json
// Error
{
  "data": null,
  "error": {
    "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR",
    "message": "The 'amount' field is required"
  }
}
```

## Monetary values

All values are sent in **cents** (the smallest currency unit).

| Real Value | API Value |
|------------|-----------|
| R$ 1,00    | 100       |
| R$ 10,50   | 1050      |
| R$ 100,00  | 10000     |

---

## Environments

The environment (Sandbox or Production) is determined by the **API credential** used. There is no separate URL per environment.

| Environment | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Sandbox** | Sandbox credentials allow tests and simulations. No real money moves. |
| **Production** | Production credentials process real PIX transactions. |

**API URL:** `https://api-payment.safefypay.com.br`

<Note>
To test, create a **Sandbox** credential in the dashboard. To go live, create a **Production** credential in the same organization.
