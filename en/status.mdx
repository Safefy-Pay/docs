## Health check endpoint

You can also monitor the API programmatically:

```
GET https://api-payment.safefypay.com.br/health
```

- **HTTP 200** — API is healthy and operational
- **Non-200** — API is unavailable or degraded

---

## Use cases

- **External monitoring** — integrate the health endpoint into your alerting system (e.g., UptimeRobot, Datadog)
- **Incident diagnosis** — quickly check whether an issue is on our side or yours
- **Staging environment** — verify the API is reachable before running automated tests
