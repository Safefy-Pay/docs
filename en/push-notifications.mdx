The Safefy panel supports **push notifications** to keep you informed of important events  such as new payments and cashout updates  directly on your device.

## Prerequisites

Push notifications require:

- A browser that supports the **Notifications API** and **Service Workers**
- The panel must be installed as a **PWA** on iOS

<Warning>
**iOS users:** Push notifications only work when the Safefy panel is installed as a PWA (Progressive Web App). If you access it through a regular Safari tab, notifications will not be delivered.
</Warning>

## Per-device notifications

> **Example:** If you have 3 devices with notifications enabled, a new payment will trigger 3 separate notifications  one on each device.
