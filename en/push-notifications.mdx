Push notifications deliver real-time alerts about payments, cashouts, and security events.

## Prerequisites

- The browser must support Notifications, Service Worker, and Push.
- **On iOS**, push notifications only work when the dashboard is installed as a **PWA**.

<Warning>
On iOS, push notifications do not work in a regular Safari tab. You must install the PWA on the Home Screen.
</Warning>

## 1. Install the PWA

### iOS (Safari)

1. Open the dashboard in Safari.
2. Tap **Share**.
3. Select **Add to Home Screen**.
4. Open the app from the installed icon.

### Android (Chrome)

1. Open the dashboard in Chrome.
2. Tap **Install app**.
3. Confirm the installation.
4. Open the app from the home screen.

### Desktop (Chrome/Edge)

1. Open the dashboard in the browser.
2. Click the install icon in the address bar.
3. Confirm the installation.

## 2. Enable in settings

1. Go to **Settings → Notifications** in the dashboard.
2. Enable **Push notifications**.
3. Allow notifications when the browser prompts you.

If permission is blocked, reopen the dashboard and allow it in the browser settings.

## 3. Per-device delivery

Push notifications are sent to **each enabled device** for the same user.

### Examples

- If the user enables push on **iPhone** and **Laptop**, both receive the notification.
- If the user enables push on **3 devices**, the same notification is sent to all 3.
- If a device is disabled, only enabled devices receive it.
